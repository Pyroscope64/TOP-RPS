# TOP-RPS
The Rock Paper Scissors project as part of the Odin Project.
Note: The project says to use a for loop to play a determined number of rounds.
My code instead uses the button as a "Play" button, playing an undetermined number of rounds.
Every click just plays another round and the button logs the score.
